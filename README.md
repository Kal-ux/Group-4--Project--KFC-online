Overview:
The system will be developed for the KFCbranchlocated at Chancellor Hall, UWI, Mona.KFC is a popular fast-food franchise known for its buckets of fried chicken, wings and sides.  The UWI Mona branch caters to members of the university community, but especially students.  Before Covid-19 the restaurant would serve up to 1500 persons on a good business day. The long waits to purchase food at UWI’s KFC is typically caused by inefficient staff and it negatively impacts customer experience and business efficiency, which further impacts profits and sales.  Customers can expect to face long lines during the week and even longer lines on weekends.   Peak hours such as lunch and dinner hours also have increased crowds.  The ordering process may take as long as 30 minutes during these times.If this issue persists, potential customers will be dissuaded from patronizing the restaurant and KFC will lose revenue and have its reputation further tarnished by negative customer reviews. The software to be developedwill allowKFC customersto pre-order their desired meals.  Customerswould then be notified when their orders are ready and available for pick-up. The software should be available online.
